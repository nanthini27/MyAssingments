1.What is oops stands for?
    OOPS-Object Oriented Programming Language
2.What is Polymorphism? explain types?
    polymorphism  is multiple form of implementation.
           1. compiletime polymorphism
           2. runtime polymorphism      
 
3.what is interface and example in selenium,java?
           planning - designing - implementation
         Interface is a unimplement methoad
         interface dosn't create object
         interface only used for public & default
         selenium ex, 
             webelement
         java ex,
             search context
         
4.what is abstarct class and example?
     * abstract class is unimplemented method. 
     * If there is an unimplemented method in class, we need to change the class into abstract class.
     * concrete class, it only have 100% implemented class.
     * abstract class also dosn't create object
     * abstract class partially used for future purpose
   
5.Difference between multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance
        *  Multiple inheritance  inherits from more than one base class.
        *  Multilevel inheritance  inherits from derived class, making that derived class a base class for a new class 
6.Is multiple inheritance possible in java?
    No,it's not possible
7.What is keyword for using inheritance  
    keyword for inheritance is "Extends" 
8.what is the keyword to connect interface and class
  Implements is keyword of connecting interface & class
9.what is difference between class and interface
      * A class describes the attributes and behaviors of an object. 
      * An interface contains behaviors that a class implements
10.what is difference between class and abstract class
      1. A class doesn't contain an abstract method. 
         A class can be declared as final.
      2. An abstract class may or may not contain abstract methods. 
         It can't be declared as final.
